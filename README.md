## Problem Statement

â€¢	This dashboard allows the HR or the leadership to understand the reason for attrition and can try to improve themselves to reduce the attrition rate and provide more opportunity for the employees


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a excel file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset" to check the empty and error percentage.
- Step 4 : It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present
- Step 5 : Since the data contains various parameters such as Salary, Age, Job Title and Job Satisfacation Bar Graphs and metrics table have been used to represent the findings.
- Step 6 : Visual filters (Slicers) were added for Job Role and Gender
- Step 7 : Metrics table has been used as a heat map to show the most and least attrition by job role against the job satisfaction
- Step 8 : Pie chart has been used to show the attrition by the employee education
- Step 9 : Area chart has been used to show the attrition by years of employement in the company
- Step 10 : Cards have been used to show the KPI such as Total Number of Employees, Count of Attrition, Attrition rate, Avg Age of the employees, Avg Salary, Avg years of the employee spent in the organization
  
- Step 12 : New measure was created to find the attrition

```DAX
Attrition_Rate = SUM(HR_Analytics[Attrition_count])/SUM(HR_Analytics[EmployeeCount])
```

A single page report was created on Power BI Desktop & it was then published to Power BI Service.

  Highest Attrition by education - Life Sciences - 37.6%
  
  Lowest Attrition by education - Human Resources - 3%
 

### [2] Highest and Lowest Attrition by Age

    Highest Attrition by Age - 36-35 - 116 employess

### [5] Attrition By Years in the company

Only 2 people with over 10 years with the company have quit

 With this data the HR BP can work with the heads of the Laboratory Technicans, Sales Executive, Research Scientist, Sales Representative to find the main concern with majority of the employees leaving the company belong to their team and take corrective measures



 ## Analysis

2. We can also determine that the salary seems to be the main concern for the attrition within employees drawing lower salary
   
3. Based on the data from the attrition by eductation the leadership need to focus on making sure the employees are working based on their educational background
